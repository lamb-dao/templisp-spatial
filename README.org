* Data Preparation for TEMP-LISP

** dynamic-world-norm.py
Implementation of the dynamic world raster normalization method &&&cite

&&&impressive description
- this is a standalone program which can be applied to a single raster
- optionally produce raster and histogram of each data transformation

** map-ops.lisp
Execute all stages of spatial data preparation for the initial 70 geotiffs

- merge split flights
- clip rasters with calculation buffer
- repair nodata pixels
- normalize with standalone python implementation
- create scale invariant gaussian pyramid
- clip without calculation buffer using concensus masks
- Create composite images from normed rasters for segmentation
- export to geopackage standardized format
