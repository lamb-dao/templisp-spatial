- normalize single band geotiff

- transformation
  - log transform to attenuate long right tailed distribution
  - Calculate 1st and 99th percentiles of log-transformed data
  - remap to sigmoid curve
  - apply sigmoid

- properties
  - smooth, nonlinear, uniform normalization
  - retains underlying relative shape of the distribution
  - output raster is constrained  in range [0, 1], 32 bit floating point
  - input raster metadata is transferred to normalized raster

- this is a standalone program which can be applied to a single raster
- optionally produce raster and histogram of each data transformation

** map-ops.lisp
Execute all stages of spatial data preparation for the initial 70 geotiffs

- merge split flights
- clip rasters with calculation buffer
- repair nodata pixels
- normalize with standalone python implementation
- create scale invariant gaussian pyramid
- clip without calculation buffer using concensus masks
- Create composite images from normed rasters for segmentation
- export to geopackage standardized format

** table-ops.lisp
Execute all stages of observational data preparation, cleaning, validation and export

- calculate mean height  and weight of guard row samples
- merge samples 1001-1010 and 1-1000 on sample column
- calculate adjustment values from gross measurements
- check distributions for outliers

** segmentation notebook
Proposed field and yeild plot segmentation method using geo-sam model

Not used at small plot scale
